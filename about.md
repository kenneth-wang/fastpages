I am a graduate of NUS Business School and consider myself as an outgoing and highly driven individual with a strong emphasis on teamwork.

Currently working on pre-built AI solutions ("Bricks") for AI Makerspace, a national platform offered by AI Singapore to help SMEs and Start-ups accelerate the adoption of AI in Singapore. Active contributor to the development of information retrieval engine and auto labeling bricks.

I have a strong interest in Natural Language Processing and am currently seeking opportunities to be at the intersection of Finance and AI.

Looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and learn something new every day!
