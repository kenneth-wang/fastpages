AI Engineer (Apprentice) @ AI Singapore | Aspiring AI/ML Engineer 

Hi! I’m Kenneth. I’ve always had an unexplained interest for coding which goes all the way back to my undergraduate days where I was just exploring coding for fun. In my earlier career days, I tried to automate my team’s everyday workflows using Excel VBA to free up more time. Given the multiple benefits I’ve gained from the codes, I set my heart on pursuing more.

Gradually, I moved on to MOOCs to broaden my skillsets and Andrew Ng was my best friend for the weekends and I can still clearly remember the very first time I printed “Hello World” with Python on my computer.

Today, I’m happy to embark on this journey in my career in Data Science! I am more inspired than ever to solve daily problems with modern technology. Coming from a non-technical background, I know first-hand exactly how tough it is to pick up coding and it is with this understanding that I started blogging. I hope to empower others to pick up the same through this blog and by sharing my AI/ML learnings. 
Feel free to reach out! I always look forward to connect with like-minded individuals and learn something new every day. Cheers!
